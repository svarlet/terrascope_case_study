## Project delivery

### Principles

Rooted in Agile principles and a Product Mindset, the following customer-centric delivery plan aims to slice feature development to achieve small-yet-frequent value-add deliveries.

The Product Team and the customers will collaborate _directly_ to codevelop the product by prioritizing value-adds, and tweaking, reworking, or pivoting early until efforts achieve customer success. We will avoid information relays or silos, sometimes observed when the Product Team is not directly connected to the customers. Doing so, we aim to engage the Product Team beyond coding, and engage customers in building the product they love, thereby fostering Employees and Customers retention.
